# Netflix-Data-Analysis

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset obtained from Kaggle.com and draw meaningful conclusions about the streaming service's content. The analysis aims to address the following key questions:

Which countries are the most significant contributors to Netflix's content library in terms of the number of titles produced?
How does the distribution of movies and TV shows compare on Netflix, and what insights can we gather from this data?
What are the five least and most popular genres on Netflix, and how do they contribute to user engagement and viewership?
In which year did Netflix release the most number of titles, and what factors might have contributed to this trend?

By addressing these questions, the project aims to provide actionable recommendations to Netflix for enhancing its content offerings and optimizing its content release strategy to cater to diverse user preferences effectively.
